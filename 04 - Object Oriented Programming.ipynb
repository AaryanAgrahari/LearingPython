    "## What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual **objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent a person with **`properties`** like a name, age, and address and **`behaviors`** such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common programming paradigm is `procedural programming`, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a `set of steps`, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well."

    "## Classes vs Instances\n",
    "**`Classes`** are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `class` is a `blueprint` for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and an age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name or age of any specific dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an **`instance`** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.\n",
    "____\n",
    "Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is like a form that has been filled out with information. Just like many people can fill out the same form with their own unique information, many instances can be created from a single class.`\n",
    "____"
   ],

   "source": [
    "## How to Define a Class:\n",
    "All class definitions start with the **class** keyword, which is followed by the name of the class and a colon. Any code that is indented below the class definition is considered part of the class’s body.\n",
    "### Here’s an example of a Dog class:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "Defining some properties that all Dog objects should have. There are a number of properties that we can choose from, including name, age, coat color, and breed. To keep things simple, we’ll just use name and age.\n",
    "***\n",
    "The properties that all Dog objects must have are defined in a method called `__init__()`. Every time a new Dog object is created, `__init__()` sets the initial state of the object by assigning the values of the object’s properties. That is, `__init__()` initializes each new instance of the class.\n",
    "***\n",
    "You can give `__init__()` any number of parameters, but the first parameter will always be a variable called **`self`**. When a new class instance is created, the instance is automatically passed to the self parameter in `__init__()` so that new attributes can be defined on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let’s update the Dog class with an `__init__()` method that creates .name and .age attributes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "### In the body of `__init__()`, there are two statements using the self variable:\n",
    "1. self.name = name creates an attribute called name and assigns to it the value of the name parameter.\n",
    "2. self.age = age creates an attribute called age and assigns to it the value of the age parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes created in `__init__()` are called **`instance attributes`**. An instance attribute’s value is specific to a particular instance of the class. All Dog objects have a name and an age, but the values for the name and age attributes will vary depending on the Dog instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **`class attributes`** are attributes that have the same value for all class instances. You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of `__init__()`. For example, the following Dog class has a class attribute called species with the value \"Canis familiaris\":\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Class attribute\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"\n",
